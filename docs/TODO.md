# TODO
  - Build drunk at the bar glass drinking scene
  - If there is time, build drunk walking to the bar scene, if there is not time, just the drinking scene would be better than just the walking scene
  - Make find or buy assets that are better than what your daughter could do (she is 5)
  - Move scene preload stuff to one big preload file -- maybe move scene preloads out of the class, then give scene folder index a preload method that calls all of them, then preload scene calls that method.
  - Edit tower defense zombie, top row of pixels has some non-transparent pixels
  - Add bad mob to bar scene, if you touch it you lose
